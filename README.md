# ObjectTracker3.1
# TRACKING PART
Single or multiple tracking can be done in the code. For this you just need to change the SINGLE_FILE_ANALYSIS parameter in the script.When the tracking algorithm is started, a gui will open on the side. You can select the Stop button to stop, the Finish button to finish, the Back and Next buttons to switch between frames, and the New Roi button to select a new ROI. To switch to a frame you want, you must first press the Wanted button and enter the number in the box (When you press the first Wanted button, the 1st frame will go away, don't worry, what happened until then has been recorded.) You can follow the graph instantly while the tracking process is in progress.
# ANALYSIS PART
AnalayzingCSV must be True (AnalayzingCSV = True) for the analysis part to work. When you run it, you need to select the video and csv file you want to analyze. It also selects a file once in a while, but it doesn't matter. After the image comes, you have to press the button to be able to operate. The key assignments are as follows:
"n" => Next Frame
"b" => Previous frame
"c" => To choose a new point
"p" => Finish the code

Please be careful not to press any key other than these keys, otherwise you will get a warning message. 
As a result, the new csv file will be extracted to the folder with the .py file with the same name of the video.




Enjoy your work.
